# Assessment: Mandelbrot
This directory contains my work toward the mandelbrot assessment.

## How to run
`cd <your_dir_path_to_repo>/Mandelbrot`
`./mandelbrot.sh -x <val> -y <val> -w <val> -h<val> -s <val>`
Optionally, you can also provide values for max iterations, bound, power, and the
filename for your plot.

## Takeaways
This was my first time actually calling a nodejs package from a Python script,
so it was an interesting challenge! I also really enjoyed learning to use the
Commander nodejs package.
